This is still under development. Sorry for all the bugs!

You can report bugs [here](https://github.com/kienD/check-this-out/issues)!

## Deployment
`yarn && yarn build` or `npm install && npm build`

or you can install directly from the npm store `npm install -g check-this-out`

## Usage
If you installed from the npm store you can use `cto` to display your most recently checked out branches.

If you built the package yourself you can create an alias `alias cto=/path/to/index.js` or symlink `index.js` to your `bin`.
